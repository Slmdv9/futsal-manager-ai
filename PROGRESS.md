# Progress Log

## Current Verified State

- Repository root: `/Users/samuellopez/Desktop/NextDigital/Next_Training/AIExpert/repo/futsal-manager-ai`
- Current branch: `main`
- Standard startup path: `./init.sh`
- Standard verification path: provisional — not bootstrapped yet
- Current next ready feature: `bootstrap-app-shell`
- Current blocker: stack decision pending; Board Data schema and seed content licensing must be resolved before board and content work
- Last verified at: `2026-10-26` (harness only; no application code)

## Session Log

### Session 001

- Date: `2026-10-26`
- Goal: Create the minimal startup harness from the completed discovery docs.
- Completed: `init.sh`, `PROGRESS.md`, and `feature_list.json` created; `AGENTS.md` updated to reflect the harness and startup workflow.
- Verification run: `./init.sh`; JSON validation of `feature_list.json`; dependency-reference check.
- Evidence captured: harness script exits successfully and reports pre-bootstrap; feature list parses as valid JSON with no missing or cyclic dependencies.
- Files or artifacts updated: `AGENTS.md`, `init.sh`, `PROGRESS.md`, `feature_list.json`.
- Known risk or unresolved issue: stack is undecided, so no real install/verify/start commands exist yet; seed content licensing is still blocking.
- Next best step: resolve the stack decision, then implement `bootstrap-app-shell`.
